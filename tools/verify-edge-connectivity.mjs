//
// The point of this tool is that the paths it tests are NOT interchangeable:
//
//   next (dev server) `vite dev`, in workerd. It binds no VPC Service: each
//                     unit's vite.config.ts passes `remoteBindings: false`
//                     outside the `vpc` tier, so the Rails half of /health here
//                     can never be VPC evidence. `next` is the mode's CLI name
//                     and nothing more.
//   preview           local workerd, `--env development`. No binding either.
//   preview:vpc       local workerd, `--env vpc`. The real remote binding.
//   vpc (this tool)   the binding alone, with no application code in the way.
//
// `/health`'s Rails half in the dev server can prove only the explicitly enabled
// private Podman path. It is never accepted as VPC or Tunnel evidence. Those
// paths have their own checks and no transport falls back to another.
