// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Rate limit namespaces, ACROSS units
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// A rate limit counter is keyed on (namespace_id, key) and is scoped to the
// Cloudflare ACCOUNT, not to the Worker: "Two rate limiting bindings that share
// the same namespace_id — even across different Workers on the same account —
// share the same rate limit counters for a given key."
//
// This repository shares one namespace per brand per tier on purpose. The key is
// the client IP, so a merged budget bounds one client's own total across the
// brand; giving each unit its own namespace would instead hand every client a
// fresh budget per subdomain, which is a bypass no limit value can close.
//
// What that buys has a price, and this is it: bindings sharing a namespace_id
// must agree on the budget. Cloudflare does not define the behaviour when two
// disagree, and the strictest binding would fire against the COMBINED count —
// so a unit that quietly lowered its own limit would start rejecting traffic at
// a threshold set by its siblings' load. Nothing at runtime would report that;
// the binding resolves and the 429s look ordinary. Config is the only place it
// can be caught.
