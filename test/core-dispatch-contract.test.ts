/**
 * The shared-FQDN route ownership contract, asserted once for all three Cores.
 *
 * `classifyCorePath` decides which requests to `jp.umaxica.{app,com,org}` reach
 * Rails, which reach the application, and which reach neither. It is duplicated in three
 * `src/lib/core-dispatch.ts` copies, deliberately — `CLAUDE.md` forbids
 * extracting a shared module — and until this file existed nothing checked that
 * the three agreed. Each Core's own `test/core-dispatch.test.ts` covers its own
 * copy against its own table, which is exactly the shape of test that lets three
 * tables drift apart in lockstep with three implementations.
 *
 * So the table below is the contract, held once, and every Core is measured
 * against it by CALLING it — not by reading its source. A copy that returns the
 * right answers is correct however it is written; a copy that reads identically
 * and behaves differently is not, and only execution can tell the difference.
 *
 * The paths where Edge and Rails both have a route are the interesting rows. They
 * are intentional Edge overrides, recorded in
 * `adr/009-rails-health-entrypoint-and-dispatch-operability.md` and in the
 * comment block at the top of each `core-dispatch.ts`.
