# Dev Containers CLI startup on rootless Podman

`scripts/devcontainer-up` is the supported CLI entry point. The Podman options could be typed
directly, but the launcher also holds a host-user-wide lock while `devcontainer up` runs.
That lock is required because Dev Containers CLI 0.89.0 hard-codes the fallback Feature-content
image name `dev_container_feature_content_temp`; concurrent Podman builds from different
repositories can otherwise replace the image before its consuming `COPY` runs.

## Starting the container

From the repository root:

```bash
scripts/devcontainer-up
```

Then open a shell — `--docker-path` is required here too:

```bash
devcontainer exec --docker-path /usr/bin/podman --workspace-folder . -- bash -l
```

## Why each part is required

`--docker-path /usr/bin/podman` — Dev Containers CLI shells out to `docker` for every
lifecycle query. A real Docker installation may be present on the development host, so
omitting this flag does not fail loudly; it silently drives the wrong engine, and the
resulting container has none of the rootless properties this project depends on.

`PODMAN_COMPOSE_PROVIDER=/usr/bin/podman-compose` — this is the part that actually selects
the Compose implementation, and it is not optional. Once `--docker-path` points at Podman,
the CLI invokes the `podman compose` subcommand rather than the `--docker-compose-path`
executable, and `podman compose` delegates to an external provider that prefers
`docker-compose` when one is installed. Without the variable the build fails at
`unix:///run/user/<uid>/podman/podman.sock: no such file or directory`, because real Docker
Compose is trying to reach a Docker daemon. This was verified on this host, not assumed.

`--docker-compose-path /usr/bin/podman-compose` — kept because the CLI still uses it on the
paths where it invokes a standalone Compose binary instead of the subcommand. It is not a
substitute for the environment variable.

`--workspace-folder` — the launcher resolves the repository root from its own location, so it
does not depend on the caller's current directory.

The lock is `${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR:-/tmp}/devcontainers-feature-content.lock`. Its name is
deliberately not Edge-specific: launchers for other repositories using the same rootless Podman
storage must take the same lock. If another cooperating build is active, this launcher waits
instead of allowing the shared temporary image tag to be replaced.

## What the configuration already does

`devcontainer.json` declares no `initializeCommand` of its own, and nothing has to run on
the host before a build. Two hooks used to: one wrote the host `UID`/`GID` into the
repository-root `.env` because a bare `userns_mode: keep-id` passes the host id through
while the image bakes 1000 into `/home/edge`; the other deleted containers left over from an
earlier Compose project name for this workspace folder, which `devcontainer exec` — it
selects by the `devcontainer.local_folder` label, not by Compose project — would otherwise
pick, failing with `can only create exec sessions on running containers: container state
improper` while naming neither container.

Both causes were removed rather than papered over. `userns_mode: keep-id:uid=1000,gid=1000`
pins the in-container id, so the host id no longer needs to be discovered, and every compose
file sets the same `name: umaxica-apps-edge`, so no new project name can appear for this
folder.

`devcontainer.json` lists `../compose.yaml` and nothing else. The Dev Containers CLI passes
each `dockerComposeFile` entry to Compose as `-f`, so an entry a fresh clone does not contain
fails the whole `up` at configuration resolution — which is how a gitignored overlay used to
break Codespaces. The same `-f` also suppresses Compose's auto-discovery of
`compose.override.yaml`, so the optional local override applies to `scripts/dev-start` and a
bare `docker compose`, not to the editor. If a leftover from before that fix is still around, `podman rm --force` it once.

`cloudflare-tunnel` declares no `depends_on: core` for a related reason. Podman turns a
Compose dependency into a container dependency, and `--remove-existing-container` runs a bare
`podman rm -f <core>` with no `--depend`, so the connector beside it would fail the removal
and take the whole `devcontainer up` with it.

The Podman-specific properties are Compose concerns and need no flags:
`userns_mode: keep-id:uid=1000,gid=1000`,
`security_opt: [no-new-privileges:true]`, `cap_drop: [ALL]`, `init: true`, the
`CONTAINER_UID`/`CONTAINER_GID` build arguments, loopback-only port publication on
`127.0.0.1`, and the named volumes
`node-volume`, `home-cache`, `pnpm-store`, and `workspace-secrets-mask`. The
Edge's `cloudflare-tunnel` sidecar is declared in `compose.yaml` beside `core`, uses the compose default
network, and requires `CLOUDFLARED_TOKEN` from this repository's gitignored root `.env` — one variable,
no fallback. It must be Edge's own tunnel, never the value Global keeps under the same name in its own
`.env`; see `adr/014-edge-owned-development-tunnel.md`.

## What is now your responsibility

The removed launcher enforced a handful of rules mechanically. They still apply; nothing
checks them at `devcontainer up` time any more.

Run as the normal rootless Podman user. Never `sudo devcontainer` or `sudo podman` — the
container's whole security model assumes a user namespace owned by your account. Confirm with
`podman info --format '{{.Host.Security.Rootless}}'`, which must print `true`.

Keep ignored credential files out of the workspace. `.dev.vars`, `.env.local`,
`.env.test.local`, and `.env.production.local` anywhere in the tree enter the container
through the workspace bind. Dedicated credential inputs belong under `.secrets/` and are
registered as Podman Secrets. `scripts/dev-start` still refuses to start when it finds one.

Do not add `--mount`, `--secrets-file`, `--remote-env`, `--config`, or `--override-config`.
Each of them reaches past the repository's security boundary and injects host state the image
is built to exclude.

Pass `--remove-existing-container` to the launcher when a previous start failed partway. A `Created` or
`Exited` container is treated as reusable and started with `compose up --no-recreate`, so
corrected service and health-check configuration silently fails to take effect.

## Direct Compose modes

`scripts/dev-build`, `scripts/dev-start [--rails] [--tunnel]`, and
`scripts/dev-stop` are a separate, still-supported path that drives Compose directly. They
carry their own root/rootless and credential-file preflights and are unaffected by the
launcher's removal. See
[Edge development environment overview](development-environment-overview.md) and
[Edge development container](edge-development-container.md).
