# Public Information Surfaces

Project Umaxica separates application surfaces from public knowledge surfaces.
The split is **authority-level, not framework-level**: Rails remains the source
of truth for policy, mutation, and content JSON authority, and the Edge surfaces
differ in what they are allowed to do rather than in what they are built with.

> **Framework note.** `adr/004-public-information-surfaces-astro.md` (2026-08-12)
> rejected an Astro move for the content frames and stays `Rejected` as history.
> `adr/015-public-content-surfaces-astro.md` (2026-09-02) is the new record that
> `adr/013` invited: the **twelve** public content surfaces
> (`{app,com,org}/{docs,help,info,news}`) are Astro, partially superseding
> `adr/013` for those units. The three `*/core` units stay on TanStack Start and
> the five `*/apex` Workers stay on Hono (`adr/011`). Language is a URL prefix
> (`/ja/`, `/en/`) because Astro i18n needs it; region is **not** a path
> (`PUBLIC_REGION` at build time — no `/jp/`). See `adr/015` § i18n / region.
> The Rails-managed-document SSR layer is designed in `adr/015` and scheduled
> in `plans/astro-content-surfaces-remaining.md`; it is pending the Rails
> public read contract.

## Surface Matrix

| Workspace family | Core app   | Public docs | Public news | Public info | Public help |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `com`            | `com/core` | `com/docs`  | `com/news`  | `com/info`  | `com/help`  |
| `org`            | `org/core` | `org/docs`  | `org/news`  | `org/info`  | `org/help`  |
| `app`            | `app/core` | `app/docs`  | `app/news`  | `app/info`  | `app/help`  |

## Framework Ownership

The twelve public content surfaces run **Astro**. The three cores run
**TanStack Start**. The five apex workers run **Hono**. That split is `adr/015`;
`adr/004` stays `Rejected` as history.

What differs between the two archetypes is capability, and it is deliberate:

`*/core` owns RP/BFF behavior, authenticated UI, logged-in state, React Aria
surfaces, and account, organization, and avatar operations. It is the only
archetype that holds session material.

`*/docs`, `*/news`, `*/info`, and `*/help` are public content surfaces. They are
limited to public content and read-only content APIs.

Rails Core/Base owns durable authority: policy, mutation, content JSON, and the
API contracts consumed by edge surfaces.

## Content API Boundary

Public information surfaces consume only public, read-only Rails content APIs
through the Cloudflare Workers private connectivity boundary. The contract is
intentionally narrow:

- Server-side GET requests only.
- Public/read-only content JSON only.
- No Acme refresh tokens.
- No user-scoped secrets.
- No browser session-cookie forwarding.
- No generic Rails proxy endpoint on a public surface.

Authenticated RP/BFF behavior remains in `*/core`. Authorization and mutation
remain in Rails.

Two mechanisms enforce this rather than convention alone: `*/core/src/worker.ts`
strips credentials on the Rails hop (ADR 007), and
`tools/workers-manifest.json` classifies each Worker so `pnpm run check:workers`
fails a surface that declares a binding its class is not allowed to hold.

## Implementation State

The three cores are classified `railsBackedVite` and the twelve public surfaces
`railsBackedAstro` in `tools/workers-manifest.json`. All fifteen carry the VPC
binding.
On the twelve public surfaces the only thing that binding is used for today is
`/health`: `src/lib/rails-client.ts` and `src/lib/rails-health.ts` verify Rails
through Rails `GET /api/v0/health.json` (ADR 016) and map the result onto Edge's
`text/plain` operational contract. **No public surface fetches content from
Rails yet**, so the narrow contract above is a boundary that has not been tested
against a real consumer.

When content fetching lands, it lands inside that existing client rather than
beside it, and `docs/caching-and-isr.md` is the open question that has to be
answered in the same change — there is no caching layer in front of these
surfaces today.
