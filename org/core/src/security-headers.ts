/*
 * Defense-in-depth headers for every response this Worker produces.
 *
 * They are applied at this unit's request boundary, which sees every response
 * the application produces and nothing else — Cloudflare
 * matches static assets BEFORE the Worker runs, so files under `public/` never
 * reach this code and take their headers from `public/_headers` instead. That
 * split is the same one the apex Workers already live with, and `public/_headers`
 * carries its own `nosniff`/`X-Frame-Options` pair for exactly that reason.
 *
 * `vite dev` is the only server that needs a looser policy. The dev bundle and
 * React's development build both call eval(), and Vite injects inline scripts of
 * its own (the HMR client, React Refresh's preamble) that this code never sees
 * and cannot nonce. So the development branch keeps `'unsafe-inline'` and adds
 * `'unsafe-eval'`, and PRODUCTION carries neither: it names a per-request nonce
 * instead (`security-nonce.ts`), which TanStack threads onto the one inline
 * script it emits. Naming a nonce is what makes a browser ignore
 * `'unsafe-inline'`, so the two are alternatives rather than a pair — which is
 * why the branch is on the whole source list and not just one token.
 * `test/content-security-policy.test.ts` asserts both sides of that branch — the
 * Hurl suite runs against `vite dev` and can only ever observe the development
 * half.

 * contract forbids a static `style=` attribute outright.
 *
 * The nonce is named here as well as on `script-src` because TanStack's `Asset`
 * component threads it onto `<style>` and `<link>` too. Its inline-CSS path is
 * dormant in this build, but if it ever activates the policy already covers it
