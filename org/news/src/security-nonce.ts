/*
 * The per-request CSP nonce, and the only channel that carries it.
 *
 * `createStartHandler` calls the router entry's `getRouter()` with no arguments,
 * once per request, so there is no parameter to thread a nonce through and a
 * module-level variable would be shared by every request the isolate has in
 * flight at once. `AsyncLocalStorage` is the one mechanism that scopes a value
 * to the request that created it; `nodejs_compat` is already on for this Worker.
 *
 * The nonce exists in PRODUCTION only. `vite dev` injects its own inline scripts
 * (the HMR client, React Refresh's preamble) which carry no nonce, and a policy
 * that names a nonce makes a browser IGNORE `'unsafe-inline'` entirely — so a
 * nonce in development would block the dev server's own bootstrap rather than
 * harden anything. `security-headers.ts` keeps the `'unsafe-inline'` branch for
 * that case and this module simply yields `undefined` there.
 *
 * This file is imported by `getRouter()`, which ships in the client bundle.
 * `node:async_hooks` cannot live here: Vite externalises it for the browser and
 * a top-level `new AsyncLocalStorage()` throws, which used to kill the whole
 * client graph — the service-worker `useEffect` never ran, and
 * `navigator.serviceWorker.ready` hung until the Playwright timeout. The Worker
 * installs the real store from `security-nonce-als.ts` (imported only from the
 * server handler). The default below is a nested-call stack for Vitest; it is
 * not safe across concurrent Worker requests, which is why the handler replaces
 * it before serving.
