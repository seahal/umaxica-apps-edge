/**
 * First code the Workers runtime invokes for every request to this frame's Core
 * hostname — before any application code runs. The hostname itself is
 * `PUBLIC_CORE_HOST` in `./lib/core-dispatch`, which is the one line that
 * differs between the three brands; this file is byte-identical across all
 * three, so it names no brand. See `adr/007-shared-fqdn-core-dispatch.md`.
 *
 * - Rails-owned paths never reach `appHandler.fetch`: dispatched directly to
 *   Rails over the Workers VPC binding, with the browser's Cookie/CSRF/auth
 *   headers preserved verbatim.
 * - Blocked paths never reach Rails or the application.
 * - Everything else (the default) is application-owned: the inbound `Cookie`
 *   header is stripped before `appHandler.fetch` is ever called, and any
 *   outbound `Set-Cookie` is stripped from the response before it reaches the
 *   browser — application code never observes a `Cookie` it was sent, and never
 *   gets to set one the browser will keep.
 *
 *   This file names `./lib/app-handler` rather than a framework, so which
 *   framework renders the application half stays behind that one-function seam.
 *
 * Rate limiting happens here, once, for both branches — the first-touch position
 * `adr/010-first-touch-rate-limiting.md` requires. Answering it here rather than
 * inside the application half is what keeps a rejected request from booting the
 * application at all.
 *
 * Every response this file produces ITSELF — the block, the 429, the 503 — goes
 * through `withSecurityHeaders`. `app-handler.ts` headers the documents the
 * application renders and a Rails-owned response stays Rails' to header (that is
 * the ADR 007 boundary), but the three answered here belong to neither and were
 * previously served bare: no CSP, no `X-Frame-Options`, no `nosniff`. They carry
 * no nonce because none of them carries a script.

/**
 * Every machine-facing path this frame serves.

 * `isUnmeteredProbe` below: dropping non-ASCII client headers before the
 * application sees them is free and has nothing to do with what the limiter
 * counts, so the two questions are asked separately even though the older
 * spelling answered both with one list.

 * Each of these three is a constant: no binding read, no Rails hop, nothing that

 * endpoint an orchestrator trusts to mean "alive" must not be throttleable.
 *
 * `/health` and `/health/readinesses` are deliberately absent. Both fetch Rails
 * over the Workers VPC binding (`src/routes/health.ts`,
 * `src/routes/health.readinesses.ts`), so exempting them publishes an
 * unauthenticated, uncounted path into the Rails origin — one inbound request,
 * one outbound Rails request, no ceiling. Readiness is the probe whose job is to
 * answer "do not send me traffic"; being throttled is a correct answer for it,
 * and is not a correct answer for liveness or startup.
